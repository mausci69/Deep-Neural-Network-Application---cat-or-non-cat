# Deep-Neural-Network-Application---cat-or-non-cat

At the end of the course of "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", in the "Deep Learning" Specialization, in Coursera, I had to built an image classifier for pictures, able to tell me if a picture was showing a cat or not. The concept is quite simple, but everything had to be built using <em>numpy</em>, and I never had the opportunity to program a Neural Network with it, instead than a NN framework like tensorflow (mostly keras).<br>
It's also a good way to check the differences in the performances between a 2 layer NN and Deep NN (4 layers).<br>
Even though the training set had a little more than 200 images (definitely not enough), and even though through a basic dense NN with no convolutional filters (which is okay, considering the datasets dimensions), and even though the architecture showed definitely a huge overfitting (again, the training set is too small), this network reached (in its 4-layers version) an 80% accuracy on the testing set.
Thanks to Andre NG for its amazing contents.
